# Project Overview

# Coding Guidance
- Avoid creating new data structures unless clearly necessary.
- Avoid helper functions that are called only once; inline or integrate instead.
- Avoid runtime type checks that imply dual usage types; make data flow stringent and types unambiguous.
- Prefer minimal, direct changes that match existing datamodel patterns.

# Collaboration Expectations
- Proactively flag issues or simplifications you notice, even if not asked.
